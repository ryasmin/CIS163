**Exercise 1:** Identidy Mutable vs Immutable
- `a = 10`
- `b = 3.14`
- `c = "hello"`
- `d = [1, 2, 3]`
- `e = {"x": 1, "y": 2}`
- `f = None`

<br/>

**Exercise 2:** What would be the outputs of each of the given code segments?
```
x = 5
y = x
y += 1
print(x, y)
```

<br/>

```
a = [1 , 2 , 3]
b = a
b.append (4)
print(a, b)
```

<br/>

**Exercise 3:** Print the elements in the given list.
- using `range()`,
- without using `range()`.
```
lst = [1, 2, 3]
```

<br/>

**Exercise 4:** Print the elements of the given matrix as in the expected sequence.
- Row-wise: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`
- Column-wise: `1 4 7 2 5 8 3 6 9`
- Only Diagonal elements: `1 5 9`
```
matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9]]
```

<br/>

**Exercise 5:** 

(a) What would be the output of the following code snippets?
```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
for x in fruits:
  if "a" in x:
    fruits.remove(x)
print(fruits)
```

```
nums = [1, 2, 3]
for i in nums:
  nums.append(i**2)
```

(b) Is there anything wrong with the outputs? If there is, how would you solve them?

<br/>

**Exercise 6:** Remove all even numbers from the given list of integers.
```
numbers = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9]
```

<br/>

**Exercise 7:** Remove your faculty's name from a pizza party list.
```
fun_people_list = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "faculty_name", "e"]
```
